# ICAMSC / DCCOI Cloud Identity Working Group

This is the github collaboration site for the ICAMSC / DCCOI Cloud Identity Working Group. We are developing a Cloud Identity Playbook over the next three months. Please leave a comment as an issue or on the wiki for content to consider, best practices, challenges, and solutions. The ultimate deliverable will be a playbook for federal agencies to plan and architect either hybrid or cloud native enterprise identity solutions.

The Cloud Identity Working Group is chartered under the direction of the Co-Chairs of the Federal Chief Information Security Officer Council (FCISOC), the Identity, Credentialing and Access Management Subcommittee (ICAMSC), and the Data Center and Cloud Optimization Initiative Program Management Office (DCCOI).

## Purpose

Create guidance to help agencies integrate and operate identity architecture components hosted in a public cloud environment, thereby facilitating the OMB cloud smart initiative within the Federal Government (USG) and ensuring secure and efficient identity management operations.

## Scope

Three focus areas:

1. Applies Federal IT policy and guidance recommendations with respect to cloud infrastructures
2. Addresses agency challenges with migrating identity infrastructures to cloud environments
3. Aligns with OMB M-19-17, Section II Managing Identities, Credentials, and Access in Modern Government 

## Timeline

The Cloud Identity Working Group is expected to hold 90-minute virtual working sessions roughly every four weeks, with a tentative wrap-up date of September 30, 2021. 

## Deliverable

The Working Groupâ€™s final deliverable will be a Cloud Identity Playbook to help federal agencies plan and architect hybrid or cloud native identity solutions. Final draft for ICAMSC and DCCOI review by September 30, 2021

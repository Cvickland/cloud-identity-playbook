- **Identity as a Service** - 

### Disclaimer
This playbook was developed by the Cloud Identity Working Group of the Federal CISO Council Identity, Credential, and Access Management subcomittee in collaboration with the GSA Data Center and Cloud Optimization Initiative (DCCOI). This playbook is meant to help U.S. Federal Executive Branch agenices understand and plan use of cloud infrastructure as it relates to the [FICAM Architecture Services Framework](https://playbooks.idmanagement.gov/arch/services/). This playbook is not official policy or mandated action and does not provide authoritative information technology terms. This playbook includes best practices to supplement existing federal policies and builds upon [Executive Order 14028](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/05/17/2021-10460/improving-the-nations-cybersecurity) and [Office Management and Budget Memorandum 19-17](https://www.bing.com/search?q=omb+memo+19-17&cvid=d6a3d59cfc214bc383193a26f643e239&aqs=edge.0.69i59j0.1774j0j4&FORM=ANAB01&PC=U531), as well as existing federal identity guidance and playbook. Subject areas with intersecting scope, such as cloud operating models, Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and enterprise governance, are considered only to the extent that they relate to either operating FICAM services or performing FICAM processes in a cloud operating model.

## Cloud Identity Overview (Create an Exec-Style One-Pager from this section)
- [ ] Cloud operating model comparison
- [ ] Term Cloud identity either align with NIST or define in Playbook.
- [ ] Identify how to consolidate identity services.

## Cloud Identity Journey
Use themes/callouts.  
  - Zero Trust Alignment
  - Challenges aligned with Governance, Risk Management, Vendor Capability, Team/Workforce Capability
  - Cloud Myths
     - More secure on-prem = Zero Trust debunked this

**MVP Content**
- [ ] Define cloud integration journey. Using cloud services may not be ultimate solution for everything. Most agenices are either all on-premise or extended some identity services to a cloud provider. Journey should start all on-premise.
- [ ] Include use of virtual directories.
- [ ] Include multi-cloud considerations.
- [ ] Secondary Content - Non-person entity interaction and use.
